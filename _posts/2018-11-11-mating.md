* The mating season for foxes are December to February.

* The Foxes primarily have one mate each winter. The pair stay together to act as parents to the new borns.

* Their gestation period(development of a child or young animal while it is still inside its mother's body) is between 51 and 53 days

* A litter of 4 – 6 kits are produced each year, however, litters may be as large as 13. Kits are born blind and may weigh as much as 150 grams

* The baby foxes open eyes by 2 weeks and take their steps out of the den by 5 weeks

* They remain with their mother until Autumn when they disperse at approximately 8 – 10 months old to find territories and mates of their own
