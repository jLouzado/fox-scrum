## Introduction
For much of the year, foxes are difficult to see in the wild. But when their cubs are born between May and July, they are vocal and more active during the day, hunting, playing or just relaxing in the sun.

## What do foxes eat?
Foxes have one of the most diverse diets in the animal world. They are expert hunters, catching rabbits, rodents, birds, frogs and earthworms as well as eating carrion. However, foxes aren’t carnivorous; they are actually omnivores who also dine on berries and fruit. Urban foxes will also scavenge for food in dustbins, and often catch pigeons and rats.

## Where do foxes live?
Foxes are fantastic diggers and live underground in excavated burrows called ‘dens’ or ‘earths’. However, foxes are also capable of living above ground, especially if they can find a sheltered spot.

## How fox protect itself from predators
Fox build small burrows or dens in grasslands to protect themselves from predators such as wolves.

## Sleeping habits
Foxes generally do not sleep in dens unless they are females who are giving birth to or raising cubs. Female foxes seek out dens made by other animals, like rabbits or badgers, but will dig their own den if necessary. Foxes in the wild curl up in a ball out in the open to sleep, retaining warmth by covering themselves with their bushy tails.
